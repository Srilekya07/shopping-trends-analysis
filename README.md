# Shopping Trends Analysis

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on shopping trends data to uncover insights about customer behavior, product popularity, and seasonal trends.

## Features

The EDA process includes:

1. **Data Overview**
   - Basic information about the dataset.
   - Checking for missing values and duplicates.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Distribution plots for numerical features.
   - Count plots for categorical variables.

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Heatmap to identify relationships between numerical variables.

5. **Customer Segmentation**
   - K-Means clustering to group customers based on age and purchase amount.
